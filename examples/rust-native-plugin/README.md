# Rust Native Dynamic Plugin

This example shows a trusted in-process Rust dynamic plugin using the
high-level `nemo-relay-plugin` SDK. It builds as a `cdylib`, exports a stable
native ABI entry symbol, validates JSON config, registers middleware and
subscribers, emits runtime marks/scopes, and creates an isolated scope stack.
Typed middleware returns futures driven by the SDK-owned Tokio executor; the
subscriber remains synchronous. The middleware demonstrates timers, async I/O,
codec use across an await, concurrent opt-in `next` calls, and stream
transformation. Set `native_concurrent_next` to `true` in an LLM request's
content to exercise the concurrent continuation path.

The example intentionally depends on `nemo-relay-plugin`, not on the host
`nemo-relay` runtime crate. Rust DTOs stay inside the plugin crate; the
dynamic-library boundary remains the stable C ABI.

## Build

Run this command from the example directory:

```bash
cargo build
```

Before you register the plugin, copy `relay-plugin.toml` to a local manifest and
replace both occurrences of `<platform-library-file>` with the file name that
`cargo build` creates for your platform:

| Platform | Library path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `target/debug/libnemo_relay_rust_native_plugin_example.dylib` |
| Linux | `target/debug/libnemo_relay_rust_native_plugin_example.so` |
| Windows | `target/debug/nemo_relay_rust_native_plugin_example.dll` |

The copied manifest must use the same relative path for `source.artifact` and
`load.library`. Calculate the library's SHA-256 digest and replace
`<artifact-sha256>` with the lowercase hexadecimal value:

| Platform | Digest command |
|---|---|
| macOS | `shasum -a 256 <library-path>` |
| Linux | `sha256sum <library-path>` |
| Windows PowerShell | `(Get-FileHash <library-path> -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()` |

Keep the `sha256:` prefix in the manifest. For example, a digest of `abc123`
is written as `sha256:abc123`.

## Register With Relay

After materializing the library path and digest, run these commands from the
repository root using the copied manifest path:

```bash
nemo-relay plugins add ./examples/rust-native-plugin/relay-plugin.local.toml
nemo-relay plugins enable examples.rust_native_policy
```

You can also reference the manifest manually from `plugins.toml`:

```toml
[[plugins.dynamic]]
manifest = "./examples/rust-native-plugin/relay-plugin.local.toml"

[plugins.dynamic.config]
tag = "demo"
block_tools = false
block_llms = false
emit_isolated_scope = true

[plugins.dynamic.config.executor]
worker_threads = 4
```

The manifest declares the `config_schema` capability and references
`config.schema.json`. After adding the plugin, use the editor for the same
configuration target (`--user`, `--project`, or `--global`) to configure the
fields without loading the native library. Schemas with
`additionalProperties: false` must include the SDK-owned `executor` object and
its positive `worker_threads` field whenever the plugin uses typed middleware:

```bash
nemo-relay plugins edit
```

The editor reads the schema file relative to `relay-plugin.toml`. It does not
run the plugin during schema discovery.

Start the gateway normally after the dynamic record is enabled:

```bash
nemo-relay --bind 127.0.0.1:4040
```

## What the Example Registers

The example registers the following runtime behavior:

- A subscriber that emits a mark when it sees non-plugin scope starts.
- Tool sanitize request/response guardrails for observability payload tagging.
- Conditional execution guardrails for tools and LLMs controlled by config.
- Request and execution intercepts for tools that mutate JSON payloads and call
  continuations.
- LLM sanitize request/response guardrails.
- An LLM request intercept that rewrites the request and schedules a mark. Relay
  emits that mark after the LLM start event with the LLM scope as its parent.
- LLM execution and stream execution intercepts.
- Runtime mark and scope events.
- A plugin-owned isolated scope stack for non-correlated visibility.

Native plugins are not sandboxed. They run in the Relay process and must not
unwind across ABI callbacks.

Request intercepts do not own an LLM lifecycle because they run before Relay
creates the LLM scope. `register_llm_request_intercept` returns one
`LlmRequestInterceptOutcome`, whose `pending_marks` Relay emits in interceptor
order after the LLM start event and before provider execution.
