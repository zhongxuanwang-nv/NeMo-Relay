# NeMo Relay

`nemo-relay-adaptive` is the Rust companion crate for adaptive NeMo Relay
runtime behavior. Use it with `nemo-relay` when an agent runtime should learn
from observed executions, inject runtime hints, persist adaptive state, or
cache repeated LLM responses.

Adaptive behavior is installed through the same plugin system used by the core
runtime, so applications can enable it without changing their orchestration
framework.

## Why Use It?

- **Install adaptive behavior through plugins**: Enable adaptive runtime
  components through the same configuration path as other NeMo Relay plugins.
- **Learn from observed executions**: Derive runtime hints from scope, tool,
  and LLM events without replacing the application framework.
- **Choose local or shared state**: Use in-memory state for local runs or the
  optional Redis backend for shared persistence.
- **Keep adaptive behavior reusable**: Package telemetry, hint injection,
  tool parallelism, and cache-governor behavior behind stable component
  settings.

## What You Get

- **`AdaptiveConfig`**: A canonical config contract for the top-level
  `adaptive` plugin component.
- **Built-in component settings**: Typed config helpers for telemetry,
  adaptive hints, tool parallelism, the Adaptive Cache Governor, and response
  caching.
- **Storage backends**: In-memory backends for adaptive state and opt-in
  response caching, with Redis-backed storage behind the `redis-backend`
  feature.
- **Learning primitives**: Runtime helpers and learners built on NeMo Relay
  events.
- **Adaptive Cache Governor (ACG) module surface**: The canonical
  `nemo_relay_adaptive::acg` module for PromptIR, provider plugins, stability
  analysis, and cache telemetry normalization.

## Installation

Install the published crate alongside the core runtime:

```bash
cargo add nemo-relay nemo-relay-adaptive
```

Enable Redis-backed storage when adaptive state or the response cache needs
shared persistence:

```bash
cargo add nemo-relay-adaptive --features redis-backend
```

For local source development:

```bash
cargo build -p nemo-relay-adaptive
cargo test -p nemo-relay-adaptive
```

## Getting Started

Create a default adaptive config and select the in-memory backend:

```rust
use nemo_relay_adaptive::{AdaptiveConfig, BackendSpec, StateConfig};

let config = AdaptiveConfig {
    state: Some(StateConfig {
        backend: BackendSpec::in_memory(),
    }),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

Register the adaptive plugin component before validating or initializing plugin
configuration that includes an `adaptive` component:

```rust
nemo_relay_adaptive::plugin_component::register_adaptive_component()?;
```

## Feature Flags

- `redis-backend`: Enables the Redis-backed storage implementation.

Builds without `redis-backend` still support the in-memory backend and the rest
of the adaptive pipeline.
