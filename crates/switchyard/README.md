# NeMo Relay Switchyard Plugin

> **Deprecated:** The experimental `nemo-relay-switchyard` plugin will be
> removed in NeMo Relay 0.8 and replaced by a Switchyard-owned native plugin.
> The NeMo Relay 0.8 documentation will include an updated configuration guide
> and migration plan when the replacement is available.

`nemo-relay-switchyard` is NeMo Relay's experimental integration
with the [NVIDIA NeMo Switchyard](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard)
Decision API. It adds routing-aware LLM execution intercepts to the Relay
runtime while preserving Relay ownership of provider credentials, target
bindings, dispatch, retries, fallbacks, and observability.

NeMo Relay 0.6.0 and 0.7.0 use a separately running Switchyard Decision API
from the `topic/nemo-relay-integration` branch.

Install it from crates.io, or build it from the NeMo Relay source checkout with
the optional CLI feature while the Switchyard Decision API contract and
service/library boundary are still evolving.

Use the plugin to:

- **Route through Switchyard decisions**: Select an exact Relay-owned target
  using a versioned Decision API contract.
- **Keep provider protocols stable**: Use Switchyard's translation library for
  OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages request and response
  translation.
- **Preserve Relay execution semantics**: Keep retries, trusted fallbacks,
  credentials, streaming behavior, and optimization accounting in Relay.
- **Support staged rollout**: Run in enforce or observe-only mode with
  explicit target bindings and protocol defaults.

## Implementation and Runtime Behavior

The plugin includes the following implementation and runtime behavior:

- `SwitchyardConfig`: The typed plugin configuration contract.
- `SwitchyardRuntime`: Buffered and streaming routing intercepts.
- Decision and target validation for exact backend, model, protocol, and
  endpoint bindings.
- ATOF-backed or payload-only routing context modes.
- Routing marks and model-routing optimization contributions for Relay's
  cumulative accounting pipeline.
- Switchyard-owned protocol translation through the
  `switchyard-translation` dependency.

## Installation and Source Build

Add the crate from crates.io:

```bash
cargo add nemo-relay-switchyard
```

To build the optional CLI integration from a NeMo Relay source checkout:

```bash
cargo build -p nemo-relay-cli --features switchyard
cargo test -p nemo-relay-switchyard
```

The resulting CLI includes the Switchyard component only when the `switchyard`
feature is enabled. A default Relay build does not include this experimental
integration.

## Runtime Boundary

The current integration calls Switchyard's HTTP Decision API at runtime. Relay
does not start or supervise the Switchyard service. For ATOF-backed profiles,
Switchyard also provides the `/v1/atof/events` ingestion and accumulator
runtime. The service must therefore be running before Relay activates the
plugin. Activation performs a bounded request to the service's `/health`
endpoint and fails if it does not return `{"status":"ok"}`. This requirement
applies to enforce and observe-only rollout modes.

The current service setup is documented in
[`examples/switchyard/README.md`](../../examples/switchyard/README.md), including
the pinned topic-branch commit, local configuration, compatibility smoke test,
and trajectory workflow.

Translation runs in-process through Switchyard's Rust translation library.

## Configuration and Registration

The CLI registers the component when built with `--features switchyard` and
accepts a `[[components]]` entry with `kind = "switchyard"`. A minimal
configuration selects the Decision API and trusted protocol defaults:

```toml
[[components]]
kind = "switchyard"
enabled = true

[components.config]
mode = "enforce"
decision_api_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/routing/decision"
decision_profile_id = "my-profile"
context_mode = "payload_only"
request_materialization = "summary_only"

[components.config.default_targets]
openai_chat = "my-openai-target"
openai_responses = "my-responses-target"
anthropic_messages = "my-anthropic-target"
```

For ATOF-backed profiles, configure an enabled Relay ATOF HTTP stream sink that
has a unique `name`, targets the Switchyard ingestion URL, and uses
environment-referenced authentication headers. Set `atof_endpoint_name` in the
Switchyard component to that name. Local ATOF JSONL output alone does not
populate the Switchyard accumulator. Keep provider and Decision API credentials
outside tracked configuration files.
