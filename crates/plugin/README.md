# NeMo Relay Native Plugin SDK

`nemo-relay-plugin` is the Rust authoring SDK and stable ABI for trusted,
in-process NeMo Relay dynamic plugins. Use it to build a Rust `cdylib` that
Relay loads through the versioned native plugin interface.

Native plugins run in the Relay process and are not sandboxed. They should
depend on this crate rather than the host `nemo-relay` runtime crate, keeping
the dynamic-library boundary on the stable C-compatible ABI.

## Why Use It?

- **Author native plugins safely**: Implement `NativePlugin` with typed Rust
  callbacks instead of constructing ABI tables directly.
- **Register real runtime behavior**: Use `PluginContext` for subscribers,
  guardrails, and intercepts.
- **Keep a stable boundary**: Export one versioned native entry point through
  the `nemo_relay_plugin!` macro.
- **Use host runtime helpers**: Emit events and manage scope state through the
  high-level `PluginRuntime` wrapper.

## What You Get

- **`NativePlugin`**: Plugin kind, configuration validation, and registration
  lifecycle contract.
- **`PluginContext`**: Component-scoped registration APIs for middleware and
  subscribers.
- **`PluginRuntime`**: Typed helpers for Relay-owned scopes and marks.
- **Stable native ABI v4**: C-compatible host and plugin tables behind the
  safe Rust authoring interface. Relay negotiates frozen v3 and v2 tables for
  Relay 0.8-built plugins that target those layouts.
- **Typed async middleware**: Every typed guardrail, sanitizer, and intercept
  returns a future driven by a per-plugin SDK-owned Tokio runtime. Subscribers
  and raw synchronous ABI registrations remain synchronous.
- **Async continuations and streams**: Cloneable `ToolNext`, `LlmNext`, and
  `LlmStreamNext` handles support repeated or concurrent calls. Streaming LLM
  continuations use a pull-based host handle.
- **Canonical tool results**: `ToolNext` returns `ToolExecutionResult`, keeping
  application results and opaque annotations adjacent across native API 1.

## Installation

Add the SDK to a Rust dynamic-plugin project:

```bash
cargo add nemo-relay-plugin serde_json
cargo add tokio@1 --features io-util,macros,rt,time
```

Configure the library as a dynamic library:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

## Getting Started

Implement `NativePlugin` and export a constructor symbol:

```rust
use nemo_relay_plugin::{Json, NativePlugin, PluginContext, Result};
use serde_json::Map;

struct ExamplePlugin;

impl NativePlugin for ExamplePlugin {
    fn plugin_kind(&self) -> &str {
        "example.native"
    }

    fn register(&mut self, _config: &Map<String, Json>, ctx: &mut PluginContext<'_>) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.register_subscriber("log-events", |event| {
            eprintln!("{}", event.name());
        })
    }
}

nemo_relay_plugin::nemo_relay_plugin!(nemo_relay_register_plugin, || ExamplePlugin);
```

Build the `cdylib`, describe its entry symbol and compatibility in a
`relay-plugin.toml` manifest, then register it through the Relay CLI. See the
complete example for platform-specific artifact and manifest setup.

Use `compat.native_api = "1"`. Relay 0.8 establishes the canonical
`ToolExecutionResult` JSON contract as the native API 1 baseline. Every native
plugin must be rebuilt for Relay 0.8 and declare a `compat.relay` range that
excludes earlier versions. The recommended range is `>=0.8.0,<1.0`; an
open-ended range such as `>=0.8.0` is also valid. The manifest is the plugin
author's compatibility assertion, not proof that the artifact was rebuilt.

The JSON contract is independent of the native host-table layout. This SDK
continues to export ABI v4, whose C-compatible layouts and callback signatures
are unchanged by the tool-result cutover. Future incompatible native JSON
contract changes must increment `compat.native_api`. Relay creates one
SDK-owned Tokio executor for each configured plugin component. It defaults to
two workers: enough for modest concurrent async I/O without broadly
oversubscribing the host. Increase the count only when measured I/O concurrency
leaves callbacks queued; lower it when the host runs many components or has a
tight CPU budget. Do not block these workers; use async I/O or
`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.

Set a plugin-wide default in Rust, then let the component's TOML configuration
override it:

```rust
use nemo_relay_plugin::{NativeExecutorConfig, NativePlugin};

impl NativePlugin for ExamplePlugin {
    fn plugin_kind(&self) -> &str {
        "acme.example"
    }

    fn executor_config(&self) -> NativeExecutorConfig {
        NativeExecutorConfig { worker_threads: 4 }
    }

    // ... register and other trait methods ...
}
```

```toml
[[plugins.dynamic]]
manifest = "./relay-plugin.toml"

[plugins.dynamic.config.executor]
worker_threads = 4
```

The SDK validates that `worker_threads` is a positive integer. The default
`NativePlugin::executor_config_for_component` applies this override; plugins
can override that method when they need different configuration rules.

During plugin teardown, the SDK stops accepting new callbacks and drains
already accepted typed middleware before the plugin library unloads.

Relay scope context is restored around every poll of a registered middleware
future. Child tasks created with `tokio::spawn` do not automatically inherit
that scope context.
