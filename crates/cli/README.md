# NeMo Relay

`nemo-relay-cli` installs the NeMo Relay CLI, the `nemo-relay` binary for local
coding-agent observability. It can configure supported coding-agent hooks, run
agents through an ephemeral gateway, and diagnose local agent and exporter
readiness.

The CLI is a Rust package in this repository, but most users should interact
with the installed `nemo-relay` command rather than link against the crate.

## Why Use It?

The CLI is designed for these tasks:

- **Observe existing coding agents**: Run Claude Code or Codex through a local
  NeMo Relay gateway without changing the agent
  itself.
- **Configure transparent runs interactively**: Use the setup wizard to write
  project or user configuration for supported agents.
- **Export local sessions**: Write ATIF trajectory files, ATOF event JSONL
  streams, or typed OpenTelemetry spans from one shared config model.
- **Diagnose setup readiness**: Check config layers, `plugins.toml` discovery,
  agent binaries, persistent coding-agent integrations, hook status,
  observability outputs, and shell completions with `nemo-relay doctor`.

## What You Get

The CLI provides these capabilities:

- **`nemo-relay` binary**: The executable installed by the `nemo-relay-cli`
  Cargo package.
- **First-run setup**: Bare `nemo-relay` launches setup when no config exists,
  then runs doctor once config is present.
- **Agent shortcuts**: `nemo-relay claude` and `nemo-relay codex` start
  observed agent runs.
- **Config-driven launch**: `nemo-relay run` resolves config, environment, and
  CLI overrides for deterministic non-interactive use.
- **Hook forwarding server**: A local gateway accepts agent hook events and
  provider-shaped OpenAI or Anthropic requests.
- **Persistent agent integration**: `nemo-relay install` configures Codex or
  Claude Code with one generated MCP bootstrap and the host's
  canonical lifecycle hooks.
- **Shared gateway lifecycle**: Every persistent integration launches the same
  host-neutral `nemo-relay mcp` client. Concurrent clients share one native
  gateway on `127.0.0.1:47632`.

## Installation Options

Install the prebuilt CLI from PyPI:

```bash
pip install nemo-relay-cli-bin
```

Install the Python API and matching CLI with the optional extra:

```bash
pip install "nemo-relay[cli]"
```

Build and install the CLI from crates.io with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install nemo-relay-cli
```

Unix curl:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

For version pinning, custom installation directories, verification,
troubleshooting, and CLI usage, refer to the
[NeMo Relay installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/relay/getting-started/installation).

After installation, verify the binary with:

```bash
nemo-relay --version
```

## Getting Started

Run the first-time setup wizard:

```bash
nemo-relay
```

After setup, inspect local readiness:

```bash
nemo-relay doctor
```

To troubleshoot a specific configuration file, pass it explicitly. Doctor reports a missing or
invalid file in its configuration checks instead of stopping before diagnostics:

```bash
nemo-relay --config /path/to/config.toml doctor
```

Run a supported agent through the gateway:

```bash
nemo-relay codex
nemo-relay claude -- "summarize this repository"
```

Install persistent integrations for the supported agent CLIs on `PATH`:

```bash
nemo-relay install all
```

Use `run --dry-run` to inspect resolved config without spawning the agent:

```bash
nemo-relay run --agent codex --dry-run
```

## Configuration

User config lives at `~/.config/nemo-relay/config.toml` or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nemo-relay/config.toml`. Runtime files layer from lowest to
highest precedence as explicit-or-user, then system. An explicit `--config`
replaces the ambient user file without suppressing system configuration.
Repository-local `.nemo-relay/config.toml` files are ignored.

Set up agent entries in the top-level config with:

```bash
nemo-relay config
```

Edit gateway limits, provider upstreams, and operational logging with the
structured user-config editor:

```bash
nemo-relay config edit
```

Use `--global` for system configuration: `/etc/nemo-relay/config.toml` on Unix
or `%ProgramData%\nemo-relay\config.toml` on Windows. Global saves are
system-readable (`0644` on Unix) and reject authorization headers; use the
corresponding environment variables or a user config for credentials.

When the top-level CLI receives `--config path/to/config.toml`, the config
editor uses that exact file as its user target, so the default editor and
`config edit --user` both open it. Use `--global` to edit the system layer.

Observability exporters are configured through the plugin config. Edit the user
plugin config with:

```bash
nemo-relay plugins edit
```

When the top-level CLI receives `--plugin-config-path`, the editor uses that
exact file. Otherwise, `--config path/to/config.toml` makes the editor use the
sibling `path/to/plugins.toml`, matching runtime selection. The explicit file
replaces the user layer, so `--user` keeps that inherited target. `--global`
edits the system layer.

The top-level editor menu contains one entry per supported built-in, followed by
the dynamic plugin references in the selected physical `plugins.toml`. Dynamic
plugins with a manifest-declared JSON Schema provide structured field controls.
Other dynamic plugins use a raw JSON object editor.

The canonical plugin file is `plugins.toml`; user config lives at
`~/.config/nemo-relay/plugins.toml` or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nemo-relay/plugins.toml`. Use
`nemo-relay plugins edit --global` to edit `/etc/nemo-relay/plugins.toml` on
Unix or `%ProgramData%\nemo-relay\plugins.toml` on Windows. It is
system-readable (`0644` on Unix), so do not store credentials there. The editor
rejects schema-declared secret values in global plugin configuration.

Runtime plugin files layer from lowest to highest precedence as
explicit-or-user, then system. An explicit
`--plugin-config-path`, or a `plugins.toml` beside `--config`, replaces the
ambient XDG user file without suppressing system policy. Repository-local
`.nemo-relay/plugins.toml` files are ignored. Missing
files are skipped, and symlink aliases to one physical file are loaded once.

Minimal ATIF example:

```toml
version = 1

[[components]]
kind = "observability"
enabled = true

[components.config.atif]
enabled = true
output_directory = "./atif"
```
