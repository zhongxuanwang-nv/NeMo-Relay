# NeMo Relay Worker SDK

`nemo-relay-worker` is the Rust authoring SDK for out-of-process NeMo Relay
dynamic worker plugins. Use it when plugin code needs process isolation and
communicates with Relay through the versioned `grpc-v1` worker protocol.

Relay 0.8 establishes canonical tool results as the `grpc-v1` baseline.
Workers built for an earlier Relay release must be rebuilt with this SDK and
declare a `compat.relay` range beginning at `0.8.0` or later. The protocol name
remains `grpc-v1`, but its generated `ToolNext` response and tool-execution
outcome fields now use structural protobuf messages.

## Why Use It?

- **Isolate plugin code**: Run custom runtime behavior outside the Relay host
  process.
- **Use typed registration APIs**: Implement `WorkerPlugin` and register
  subscribers, guardrails, or intercepts with `PluginContext`.
- **Call the host runtime**: Emit marks, manage scopes, and invoke middleware
  continuations through `PluginRuntime`.
- **Keep lifecycle managed**: Let Relay provide authenticated endpoints and
  start the worker with `serve_plugin`.

## What You Get

- **`WorkerPlugin`**: The plugin identity, validation, and registration
  contract.
- **`PluginContext`**: Typed registrations for all supported worker surfaces.
- **`PluginRuntime` and continuations**: Host-runtime callbacks and tool/LLM
  execution-chain helpers.
- **Canonical tool results**: `ToolNext` returns `ToolExecutionResult`, so
  workers can preserve an opaque annotation independently of the tool result.
- **`serve_plugin`**: Tokio gRPC server startup using the Relay-provided worker
  environment.

## Installation

Add the SDK and Tokio to the worker project:

```bash
cargo add nemo-relay-worker
cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread
```

## Getting Started

Implement a worker and serve it from an async entrypoint:

```rust
use nemo_relay_worker::{Json, PluginContext, Result, WorkerPlugin, serve_plugin};

struct ExampleWorker;

impl WorkerPlugin for ExampleWorker {
    fn plugin_id(&self) -> &str {
        "example.worker"
    }

    fn register(&self, ctx: &mut PluginContext, _config: &Json) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.register_tool_request_intercept("tag-request", 0, false, |_name, mut args| async move {
            if let Some(object) = args.as_object_mut() {
                object.insert("checked".into(), true.into());
            }
            Ok(args)
        });
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    serve_plugin(ExampleWorker).await
}
```

Relay supplies the socket, activation ID, and authentication token through the
worker environment. Use `serve_plugin` for Relay-spawned workers; explicit
server configuration is intended for tests and custom launchers.

## Concurrency and Cancellation

Unary and streaming callbacks run concurrently. Cancellation is cooperative:
Relay sends `CancelInvocation` when a managed caller is cancelled, times out,
or stops consuming a stream, and the SDK aborts the matching async callback
task. An accepted cancellation confirms the task was found; it cannot prove
that arbitrary blocking work started by the callback has stopped.
