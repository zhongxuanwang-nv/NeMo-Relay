"""Regression tests for the callback handler against a real NeMo Relay scope stack.

``test_callbacks.py`` drives the handler with a ``MagicMock`` of ``nemo_relay``. That is
the right tool for asserting which calls the handler makes, but a mocked ``scope.pop``
accepts any handle in any order, so it cannot observe the stack's LIFO rule at all. The
failure covered here is exactly that rule being violated, so these tests use the real
stack.

The shape under test is two sibling chain runs that finish out of LIFO order: A starts,
B starts, A ends, B ends. That ordering is what LangGraph produces when it schedules
sibling nodes as concurrent asyncio tasks sharing one scope stack. These tests drive the
handler's callbacks directly rather than through a callback manager, so they reproduce
the stack-level consequence deterministically; they do not attempt to prove how LangGraph
dispatches callbacks, which belongs in the langgraph integration tests.

Two things make a test here easy to get wrong, so each test guards against them:

* ``on_chain_start`` logs and swallows every exception, so a handler that pushed nothing
  would satisfy "no scope was stranded" and "the stack is unchanged" while exercising
  nothing. Each test asserts the scopes were genuinely open before reading the end state.
* ``scope.push`` parents a new scope to the current top of stack unless an explicit
  parent handle is given, so callbacks that omit ``parent_run_id`` produce a nested
  chain, not siblings. The sibling runs here declare a common tracked parent run.
