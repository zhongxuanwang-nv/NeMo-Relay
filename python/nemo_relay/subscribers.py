"""Global event subscriber registration.

Subscribers observe all lifecycle events emitted by the current process,
including scope, tool, LLM, and mark events. They are typically used for
logging, metrics, tracing, and custom observability pipelines.

Example::

    import nemo_relay

    def log_event(event):
        print(f"{event.kind}: {event.name}")

    nemo_relay.subscribers.register("logger", log_event)
    try:
        with nemo_relay.scope.scope("demo", nemo_relay.ScopeType.Agent):
            nemo_relay.scope.event("started")
    finally:
        nemo_relay.subscribers.deregister("logger")
