"""Scope stack operations.

Scopes define the hierarchy that tool calls, LLM calls, and mark events attach
to. They are the main way to model agents, tasks, and nested units of work.

Example::

    import nemo_relay

    with nemo_relay.scope.scope("demo-agent", nemo_relay.ScopeType.Agent) as handle:
        nemo_relay.scope.event("checkpoint", handle=handle, data={"step": 1})
