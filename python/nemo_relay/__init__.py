"""Python bindings for the NeMo Relay runtime.

This package exposes the runtime's scope stack, lifecycle events, middleware
registries, typed wrappers, and adaptive helpers from Python.

The main entry points are:

- ``nemo_relay.scope`` for creating and nesting scopes
- ``nemo_relay.tools`` for tool lifecycle management
- ``nemo_relay.llm`` for non-streaming and streaming LLM lifecycle management
- ``nemo_relay.guardrails`` and ``nemo_relay.intercepts`` for global middleware
- ``nemo_relay.scope_local`` for middleware scoped to a specific ``ScopeHandle``
- ``nemo_relay.typed`` for codec-based typed wrappers
- ``nemo_relay.plugin`` for global plugin configuration and custom plugin registration
- ``nemo_relay.adaptive`` for adaptive component configuration helpers
- ``nemo_relay.observability`` for observability component configuration helpers
- ``nemo_relay.pii_redaction`` for PII redaction component configuration helpers
- ``nemo_relay.model_pricing`` for model pricing component configuration helpers

Top-level exports also include:

- scope stack helpers such as ``get_scope_stack()``, ``create_scope_stack()``,
  ``fork_asyncio_context()``, ``set_thread_scope_stack()``, and
  ``scope_stack_active()``
- native runtime types such as ``ScopeHandle``, ``ToolHandle``, ``LLMHandle``,
  ``LLMRequest``, ``ScopeType``, and the lifecycle event classes
- observability helpers such as ``AtifExporter``, ``AtofExporter``,
  and ``OpenTelemetrySubscriber``
- JSON and callback type aliases used by middleware, typed wrappers, and
  plugin-facing configuration helpers

Example::

    import asyncio

    import nemo_relay

    def redact_args(tool_name, args):
        return {**args, "api_key": "***"}

    def add_header(

        headers = request.headers.copy()
        headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer test-token"
        return nemo_relay.LLMRequestInterceptOutcome(
            nemo_relay.LLMRequest(headers=headers, content=request.content), annotated
        )

        return nemo_relay.ToolExecutionResult({"echo": args["query"]})

    """Return the current task's active scope stack.

    If the current async context does not yet own a scope stack, this function
    creates one and synchronizes it into the Rust thread-local storage used by
    the native runtime. Most callers do not need to invoke this directly
    because higher-level helpers such as ``nemo_relay.scope.push()`` do it
    automatically.

    Returns:
        ScopeStack: The scope stack associated with the current Python context.

    Raises:
        Exception: Propagates any exception raised by native scope-stack
            creation or synchronization.

    Behavior:
        The function first checks the Python ``ContextVar``. If no stack is
        present, it creates one with the native runtime, stores it in the
        current context, and synchronizes that stack into native thread-local
        storage before returning.

    Notes:
        Calling this function synchronizes the Python ``ContextVar`` state into
        the native thread-local slot so subsequent native runtime calls observe
        the same scope hierarchy.

    Example::

        import nemo_relay

        bool: ``True`` when the current Python context already has an active

    Raises:
        Exception: Propagates any exception raised by the native active-stack
            status check.

    Behavior:
        The Python ``ContextVar`` is checked first. If it has no stack, the
        native runtime is asked whether the current thread has an explicitly
        active stack.

    Notes:
        This function does not create a scope stack. It is a pure status check
        used to decide whether scope propagation work is required.

    Example::

        import nemo_relay

        nemo_relay.get_scope_stack()

    Returns:
        ScopeStack: The active stack from the current context.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the current context does not yet have an active scope

        Exception: Propagates any exception raised while synchronizing an
            already-active native stack into the Python context.

    Behavior:
        This function does not clone the scope hierarchy. It shares the current
        stack reference with the target thread, which is appropriate when the

    Behavior:

    Notes:
        Use this helper when you need explicit scope isolation, such as test
        fixtures, manual context propagation, or framework-managed request
        boundaries. Most application code should prefer ``get_scope_stack()``
        so the current context is initialized lazily.

    Example::

        import nemo_relay

    Notes:
