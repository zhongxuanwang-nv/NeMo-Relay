"""LLM lifecycle helpers for non-streaming and streaming calls.

This module is the LLM analogue of ``nemo_relay.tools``. It manages emitted
events, global middleware, optional request codecs for annotated intercepts,
and optional response codecs for structured end-event annotations.

Example::

    import nemo_relay

    request = nemo_relay.LLMRequest(
        {},
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}], "model": "demo-model"},
    )

    async def impl(req):
        return {"id": "r1", "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "hi"}}]}

    result = await nemo_relay.llm.execute(
        "demo-provider",
        request,
        impl,
        response_codec=nemo_relay.codecs.OpenAIChatCodec(),
    )

            provider-specific request payload.
        timestamp: Optional timezone-aware ``datetime`` recorded as the handle
            start time and on the emitted start event. When omitted, the current
            runtime time is used.

    Returns:
        LLMHandle: Handle used to finish the manual span with ``call_end()``.

    Notes:
        This starts only the manual LLM lifecycle span. It applies
        sanitize-request guardrails to the emitted start-event payload but does
        not run request or execution intercepts. ``timestamp`` must be a
        timezone-aware ``datetime``; strings and naive datetimes are rejected.

        annotated_response: Optional normalized response annotation attached to

        response_codec: Optional response codec used to derive

            observability. Ignored when ``annotated_response`` is provided.
        timestamp: Optional timezone-aware ``datetime`` recorded on the emitted

        ``call_end()`` remains synchronous. Sanitize-response guardrails,
        response-codec annotation, event sanitizers, and subscriber delivery
        run later on Relay's serial publication path. Callback and codec
        sanitizer failures are logged and fail closed; they cannot be raised by
        this call. Codec failures retain their documented fallback behavior.
        ``response_codec`` and ``annotated_response`` enrich observability
        output only and do not rewrite the caller-owned response.

    Notes:
        ``codec`` enables annotated request intercepts. ``response_codec``
        decodes the raw response for observability only and does not change the

            run. It typically accumulates state for ``finalizer``.

        ``collector`` observes the post-intercept chunk values. ``finalizer``
        runs once at natural stream completion or explicit close and should
        return a representation of the full response, not the final chunk. If
        the caller stops consuming early, call ``await stream.aclose()`` to
        cancel the producer, finalize the partial response, and release native
        stream resources.
