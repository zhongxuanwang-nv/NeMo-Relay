"""Type stubs for the public ``nemo_relay`` package facade.

Summary:
    ``nemo_relay`` exposes the Python entry point for scope tracking, lifecycle
    events, middleware registration, typed helpers, plugins, adaptive
    configuration, and native observability types.

Description:
    The concrete implementations live in Python wrapper modules and in the
    compiled ``nemo_relay._native`` extension. This stub intentionally keeps
    native classes re-exported from ``_native.pyi`` so the native module remains
    the source of truth.

Exceptional flow:
    Stub declarations do not execute. Runtime exceptions are documented on the
    corresponding implementation or native declaration.
