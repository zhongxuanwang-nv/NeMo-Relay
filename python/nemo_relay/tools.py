"""Tool lifecycle helpers.

Use this module when you want NeMo Relay to emit tool start and end events around a
piece of application logic.

``execute()`` is the usual entry point and runs the full middleware pipeline.
``call()`` and ``call_end()`` are the lower-level manual lifecycle APIs.

Example::

    import nemo_relay

    async def search(args):
        return nemo_relay.ToolExecutionResult({"result": args["query"].upper()})

    result = await nemo_relay.tools.execute("search", {"query": "hello"}, search)
    assert result.result == {"result": "HELLO"}

    """Start a manual tool span and return its ``ToolHandle``.

    Args:
        name: Tool name recorded on emitted lifecycle events.
        args: JSON-compatible tool arguments to associate with the call.
        handle: Optional parent scope handle. When omitted, the current scope
            becomes the parent.
        attributes: Optional native tool attributes attached to the start event.
        data: Optional JSON application payload stored on the tool handle.
        metadata: Optional JSON metadata recorded on the emitted start event.
        tool_call_id: Optional provider-specific tool call identifier to attach
            to the emitted events.
        timestamp: Optional timezone-aware ``datetime`` recorded as the handle
            start time and on the emitted start event. When omitted, the current
            runtime time is used.

    Returns:
        ToolHandle: Handle used to finish the manual span with ``call_end()``.

    Notes:
        This starts only the manual tool lifecycle span. It applies
        sanitize-request guardrails to the emitted start-event payload but does
        not run request or execution intercepts. ``timestamp`` must be a
        timezone-aware ``datetime``; strings and naive datetimes are rejected.

    Example::

        import nemo_relay

        handle = nemo_relay.tools.call(
            "search",
            {"query": "hello"},

        data: Optional JSON payload used when the sanitized ``result`` is JSON null.
        metadata: Optional JSON metadata recorded on the emitted end event.

        its middleware/subscriber chains have been queued for publication.

    Notes:
        ``call_end()`` remains synchronous. Sanitize-response guardrails,
        event sanitizers, and subscriber delivery run later on Relay's serial
        publication path. Callback failures are logged and fail closed; they
        cannot be raised by this call. The caller-owned ``result`` is not
        altered.

        datetimes are rejected.

    Args:
        name: Tool name recorded on emitted lifecycle events.

    Notes:
        Sanitize guardrails affect emitted event payloads only. They do not
