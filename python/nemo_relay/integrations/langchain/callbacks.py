    A scope stack closes strictly LIFO, but concurrent sibling runs finish in the order
    the graph chooses, so a run can end while scopes opened after it are still open.
    Recording the completion and closing it once it reaches the top preserves the stack's
    ordering without ever attempting a close the stack would reject.

    A completion is only ever closed when its scope is the top of the active stack, so
    ownership needs no separate check: a scope sits on exactly one stack, and its handle
    uuid can only be the current top on that stack. Comparing ``ScopeStack`` objects
    would not work anyway -- propagating a stack to a worker thread yields a different
    Python wrapper for the same stack, with no way to correlate the two.

    ``output`` is already serialized: callers own the mapping they hand to the callback
    and may mutate it afterwards, so it is snapshotted when the callback fires, for the
    same reason ``ended_at`` is.

    Entries are removed as their scopes reach the top, so the set is bounded by the runs
    a handler has open at once. The exception is a scope closed by something other than
    this handler: it can never return to the top, so its entry is retained for the life
    of the handler, holding the serialized output.
