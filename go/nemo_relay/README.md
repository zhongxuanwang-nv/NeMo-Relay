# NeMo Relay Go Binding

The Go binding exposes NeMo Relay runtime APIs through CGo and the raw
`nemo-relay-ffi` library. Use it when a Go application or integration needs the
same scope, middleware, lifecycle event, and observability model used by the
Rust runtime.

This binding is experimental and source-first. Rust, Python, and Node.js are the
primary supported surfaces.

> **DO NOT TREAT AS PRODUCTION-READY:** the experimental
> `InitializeWithDynamicPlugins` lifecycle needs a real consumer to validate
> shutdown, ownership, and error handling before it can be promoted to a stable
> contract.

## Why Use It?

Use the Go binding for the following tasks:

- **Use NeMo Relay from Go**: Group agent, tool, and LLM work into the same
  scope and lifecycle model as the Rust runtime.
- **Bridge through CGo and FFI**: Consume the shared runtime through the
  repository-maintained `nemo-relay-ffi` layer.
- **Observe runtime behavior**: Register subscribers for scope, tool, LLM,
  and mark events emitted by the runtime.
- **Evaluate an experimental binding**: Use the source-first Go surface when
  a Go integration needs NeMo Relay semantics.

## What You Get

The Go package provides the following capabilities:

- **Scope, tool, and LLM helpers**: Managed lifecycle APIs backed by the
  shared Rust runtime.
- **Middleware APIs**: Guardrails and intercepts for request rewriting,
  blocking, sanitization, and execution wrapping, including mark and scope
  event sanitizers at global, scope-local, and plugin-context levels.
- **Event subscribers**: Runtime lifecycle callbacks for observability and
  diagnostics.
- **Typed OpenTelemetry export**: `NewOpenTelemetryConfig` and
  `NewOpenTelemetrySubscriber` construct one independently managed `full`,
  `gen_ai`, or `openinference` endpoint exporter.
- **Convenience subpackages**: Short imports for scopes, tools, LLM calls,
  guardrails, intercepts, subscribers, plugins, and adaptive helpers.
- **Local source-first workflow**: Build the FFI library locally, then test or
  consume the Go module from the checkout.

Go middleware callbacks are synchronous. Relay waits for each callback on a
native thread, so blocking I/O and other long-running callback work occupy that
thread and can reduce middleware throughput. The Go binding does not provide
completion-based middleware registration.

## Installation

Build the FFI library from a repository checkout before using the Go binding:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay.git
cd NeMo-Relay
cargo build --release -p nemo-relay-ffi
```

For a Go application that consumes a local checkout, point the module at the
checked-out binding:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay=../NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay
go get github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay
```

## Getting Started

Run the binding tests from the repository checkout to verify the CGo link path
and the FFI library:

```bash
cd go/nemo_relay
go test ./...
```

Then import the package from application code:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	nemo "github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay"
	"github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay/scope"
	"github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay/tools"
)

func main() {
	defer func() {
		if err := nemo.ShutdownLogging(); err != nil {
			log.Printf("shut down NeMo Relay logging: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	if err := nemo.RegisterSubscriber("printer", func(event nemo.Event) {
		fmt.Printf("%s %s\n", event.Kind(), event.Name())
		fmt.Println(string(event.JSON()))
	}); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer nemo.DeregisterSubscriber("printer")
	defer nemo.FlushSubscribers()

	handle, err := scope.Push("demo-agent", nemo.ScopeTypeAgent)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer scope.Pop(handle)

	if err := scope.Event("initialized"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	result, err := tools.Execute("search", json.RawMessage(`{"query":"hello"}`), func(args json.RawMessage) (nemo.ToolExecutionResult, error) {
		return nemo.ToolExecutionResult{Result: args}, nil
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(result.Result))
}
```
