# Releasing NeMo Relay

This document is the maintainer playbook for cutting NeMo Relay releases. It
describes the release contract, the version files that must be updated, the tag
format that CI accepts, the package surfaces that are published, and the checks
to run before and after a tag push.

## Source Of Truth

This section defines where release history and release-facing details are maintained.

- There is no `CHANGELOG.md` in this repository.
- The documentation site has a release-notes landing page for current
  documentation-visible release status.
- The source of truth for complete release history and tag-specific release
  notes is always GitHub Releases for this repository.

Do not copy full GitHub Release notes into `CHANGELOG.md` or the docs site.
The docs release-notes page can summarize support status and point users to
GitHub Releases.

## Published Surfaces

The release pipeline publishes these package surfaces from a tag push:

| Ecosystem | Published Surface |
|---|---|
| crates.io | `nemo-relay-types`, `nemo-relay-plugin`, `nemo-relay-worker-proto`, `nemo-relay-worker`, `nemo-relay`, `nemo-relay-adaptive`, `nemo-relay-pii-redaction`, `nemo-relay-switchyard`, `nemo-relay-ffi`, `nemo-relay-cli` |
| PyPI | `nemo-relay` wheels and source distribution, `nemo-relay-plugin` and `nemo-relay-cli-bin` wheels |
| npm | `nemo-relay-node` and its seven platform packages, and `nemo-relay-openclaw` |
| GitHub Releases | CLI binaries, `nemo-relay` and `nemo-relay-cli-bin` wheels, Node npm tarballs, and checksums |
| Fern | The documentation site |

Go remains source-first. There is no separate Go package-manager publication
step in the repository release workflow.

The former npm `nemo-relay-cli-bin` metapackage and its seven platform
packages are retired and must not be republished.

The mirrored GitLab pipeline also publishes the same tag's collected package
artifacts to NVIDIA Artifactory. It is driven by the tag push, not by a GitLab
pipeline schedule.

## Version Model

NeMo Relay versions are anchored on the workspace SemVer in the repository root
`Cargo.toml`.

- The root `Cargo.toml` `workspace.package.version` is the canonical release
  version for the Rust workspace.
- The root `Cargo.toml` `workspace.dependencies` entries for
  `nemo-relay-types`, `nemo-relay-plugin`, `nemo-relay-worker-proto`,
  `nemo-relay-worker`, `nemo-relay`, `nemo-relay-adaptive`,
  `nemo-relay-pii-redaction`, `nemo-relay-switchyard`, `nemo-relay-ffi`, and
  `nemo-relay-cli` must
  stay aligned with that same version.
- `crates/node/package.json` carries the base npm version for the Node.js
  package. The repository-root `package-lock.json` carries the npm workspace
  lock entries and must be updated with it.
- `integrations/openclaw/package.json` carries the base npm version for the
  OpenClaw plugin package and must stay aligned with the same release version.
- `python/cli-bin/pyproject.toml` carries the base CLI package version in its
  PEP 440 spelling. The `nemo-relay[cli]` extra must pin the exact PyPI version.
- The Python package version is derived at packaging time. `pyproject.toml`
  stays `dynamic = ["version"]` in the repository, and the packaging recipe
  writes a concrete version into `pyproject.toml` and `crates/python/Cargo.toml`
  in the ephemeral packaging workspace.

For non-tag CI builds, packaging recipes append a commit-derived suffix:

- Node.js uses `-<short_sha>`.
- Python uses `+<short_sha>` and converts prerelease labels into PEP 440 form.
  For example, `0.2.0-rc.1` becomes `0.2.0rc1` when packaged for PyPI.

## Release Tags

Release tags must use raw Rust-compatible SemVer without a leading `v`.

- Use `0.1.0` for stable releases.
- Use `0.1.0-rc.1` for prereleases.
- Do not use tags such as `v0.1.0` or `v0.1.0-rc.1`.

CI rejects tags that do not match the required format.

The tag text must match the version that the packaging jobs publish.

Release tags for a frozen release line should be created from the matching
`release/*` branch, not from `main`.

## Code Freeze

When code freeze begins for a target release, create a release branch from the
latest `main` commit. Name the branch from the target release major and minor
version:

These examples assume `upstream` is the NVIDIA repository remote
(`NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay`). The `origin` remote is usually a maintainer's personal
fork.

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git checkout -b release/0.2 upstream/main
git push upstream release/0.2
```

After creating the release branch, open a PR against `main` that does both of
the following:

1. Add the new `release/*` branch to
   [`.github/nightly-alpha-branches.yaml`](.github/nightly-alpha-branches.yaml)
   so nightly alpha tags continue for the frozen release line.
2. Bump all package versions on `main` to the next release line:

   ```bash
   just set-version <next-version>
   ```

New PRs that must go into the upcoming release must target the new `release/*`
branch. Changes intended for later releases should continue to target `main`.

When a release branch no longer needs nightly alpha tags, open a PR against
`main` to remove that branch from
[`.github/nightly-alpha-branches.yaml`](.github/nightly-alpha-branches.yaml).

## Before You Cut A Release

Before you create a release tag, confirm the following:

1. The intended release commit is already on the release branch you intend to
   tag. For frozen release lines, tag the matching `release/*` branch.
2. The release commit contains the final version bump, docs updates, and any
   public API changes that belong in the release.
3. The working tree you use for local validation is clean or disposable.
4. Registry credentials and repository settings are in place:
   - GitHub Actions `id-token: write` access for the top-level crates.io publish job
   - crates.io trusted publishers for `nemo-relay-types`,
     `nemo-relay-plugin`, `nemo-relay-worker-proto`, `nemo-relay-worker`,
     `nemo-relay`, `nemo-relay-adaptive`, `nemo-relay-pii-redaction`,
     `nemo-relay-switchyard`, `nemo-relay-ffi`, and `nemo-relay-cli` are
     configured for the top-level
     [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) workflow
   - GitHub Actions `id-token: write` access is available for the top-level npm publish job
   - GitHub Actions `id-token: write` access for the top-level PyPI publish job
   - Pending or existing PyPI trusted publishing is configured for
     `nemo-relay-cli-bin`
   - npm trusted publishers are configured for `nemo-relay-node`,
     `nemo-relay-node-linux-x64-gnu`, `nemo-relay-node-linux-arm64-gnu`,
     `nemo-relay-node-linux-x64-musl`, `nemo-relay-node-linux-arm64-musl`,
     `nemo-relay-node-darwin-arm64`, `nemo-relay-node-win32-x64-msvc`, and
     `nemo-relay-node-win32-arm64-msvc`
5. The GitHub Release entry is ready to become the only canonical release-notes
   surface.

## Prepare The Release Commit

Update the versioned source files in the release PR or release-prep commit.
Prefer the repository helper:

```bash
just set-version <release-version>
```

The helper updates:

1. The root [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) workspace version.
2. The root [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) `workspace.dependencies` versions for
   `nemo-relay-types`, `nemo-relay-plugin`, `nemo-relay-worker-proto`,
   `nemo-relay-worker`, `nemo-relay`, `nemo-relay-adaptive`,
   `nemo-relay-pii-redaction`, `nemo-relay-switchyard`, `nemo-relay-ffi`, and
   `nemo-relay-cli`.
3. [`crates/node/package.json`](crates/node/package.json) and the `crates/node`
   entry in the root [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json) to the same
   release version.
4. [`integrations/openclaw/package.json`](integrations/openclaw/package.json)
   and the `integrations/openclaw` entry in the root
   [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json) to the same release version.
5. The Python `nemo-relay-cli-bin` metadata, including the exact
   `nemo-relay[cli]` dependency version.
Review docs and snippets that mention explicit versions, including:

- [`README.md`](README.md)
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [`docs/getting-started/installation.mdx`](docs/getting-started/installation.mdx)
- Any binding README or example that pins a release number

Do not commit a static Python package version into `pyproject.toml` just to cut
the release. The packaging workflow stamps that file during the build.

## Local Validation

Run the checks that match the surfaces affected by the release. For a normal
repository release, the safest baseline is:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
just test-rust
just test-python
just test-go
just test-node
./scripts/build-docs.sh check
./scripts/build-docs.sh linkcheck
```

If you want to validate the packaging recipes before pushing a tag, run:

```bash
just --set output_dir "$PWD/target/release-artifacts" --set ref_name 0.1.0 package-node
just --set output_dir "$PWD/target/release-artifacts" --set ref_name 0.1.0 package-openclaw
just --set output_dir "$PWD/target/release-artifacts" --set ref_name 0.1.0 package-rust
just --set output_dir "$PWD/target/release-artifacts" --set ref_name 0.1.0 package-python
just --set output_dir "$PWD/target/release-artifacts" --set ref_name 0.1.0 package-python-sdist
```

Be aware that the local packaging recipes intentionally rewrite version fields
in place while they build artifacts. In a disposable CI workspace that is fine.
In a local checkout, restore those temporary manifest edits before continuing if
you are not committing them.

## Cut The Tag

After the release commit is merged and validated, create and push the raw
SemVer tag:

```bash
git fetch upstream release/0.1
git checkout release/0.1
git pull --ff-only upstream release/0.1
git tag 0.1.0
git push upstream 0.1.0
```

Use the prerelease form when needed:

```bash
git tag 0.1.0-rc.1
git push upstream 0.1.0-rc.1
```

## What CI Does On A Tag Push

Pushing a valid tag triggers [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml).
That workflow then calls the language-specific reusable workflows for validation
and package artifact creation.

The release pipeline then:

1. Validates the tag format in the `prepare` job.
2. Runs the required repository checks, language test jobs, and Fern documentation
   validation.
3. Builds publishable package artifacts with the exact tag version:
   - `package-rust` packs the published Rust crates for local validation.
   - `package-node` packs one native npm Node.js package per supported platform,
     including GNU and musl Linux packages for x86_64 and ARM64, and creates the
     JavaScript and TypeScript metapackage once.
   - `package-openclaw` packs the npm OpenClaw plugin package.
   - `package-python` builds platform `nemo-relay` wheels, including
     `musllinux_1_2_x86_64` and `musllinux_1_2_aarch64` wheels.
   - `package-python-sdist` builds one platform-independent `nemo-relay` source
     distribution.
   - `package-python-plugin` builds the `nemo-relay-plugin` wheel.
   - The Rust CLI matrix builds GNU Linux binaries in manylinux containers and
     musl Linux binaries natively, validates each in its matching container, and
     packages each prebuilt binary as a `nemo-relay-cli-bin` wheel.
   - The distribution release-asset job uploads the CLI binaries, `nemo-relay`
     API wheels, CLI wheels, and split Node npm packages.
     `SHA256SUMS` covers every attached distribution artifact, and raw CLI
     binaries also receive individual `.sha256` files for installer
     compatibility.
     GitHub-facing npm artifacts use
     `nemo-relay-node-npm[-<os>-<cpu>]-<version>.tgz`; their registry package
     names remain in the tarball manifests.
4. Publishes packages from the top-level workflow after the reusable packaging
   jobs complete:
   - `publish-rust` stamps Cargo workspace versions from the release tag, then
     runs `cargo publish --package` for `nemo-relay-types`,
     `nemo-relay-plugin`, `nemo-relay-worker-proto`, `nemo-relay-worker`,
     `nemo-relay`, `nemo-relay-adaptive`, `nemo-relay-pii-redaction`,
     `nemo-relay-switchyard`, `nemo-relay-ffi`, and `nemo-relay-cli` through
     trusted publishing from
     the top-level workflow
   - `publish-python` downloads the `nemo-relay` wheel and source distribution
     artifacts plus the `nemo-relay-plugin` and `nemo-relay-cli-bin` wheels,
     then uploads them to PyPI with trusted publishing from the top-level
     workflow
   - `publish-npm` publishes the Node.js native packages before their
     metapackage, then publishes the OpenClaw package, through npm trusted
     publishing from the top-level workflow
     - Stable tags publish to the npm `latest` dist-tag
     - Prerelease tags such as `0.1.0-rc.1` publish to the npm `next`
       dist-tag so they do not become the default upgrade target
   - The GitHub Release entry remains a draft until a maintainer publishes it.
     End-user `nemo-relay install ...` commands require the CLI binary to be
     installed and available on `PATH`.

The workflow boundary is split intentionally:

- The language-specific reusable workflows produce publishable package artifacts
  after their tests pass.
- [`.github/workflows/fern-docs.yml`](.github/workflows/fern-docs.yml) validates
  and publishes Fern documentation independently from package CI.
- [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) owns all crates.io,
  PyPI, and npm publication decisions and credentials.
- This layout also satisfies the official `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`
  guidance that trusted publishing should not run inside reusable workflows.

The mirrored GitLab pipeline in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) handles
NVIDIA Artifactory publication for the same tag:

- GitLab starts the pipeline from a tag push through `CI_COMMIT_TAG`; no GitLab
  cron or pipeline schedule is required.
- The collector waits for the mirrored GitHub tag and matching GitHub Actions
  run, then downloads the Python wheel and source distribution, Cargo, and
  Node.js package artifacts produced by GitHub Actions.
- The Artifactory jobs publish those collected artifacts to the configured
  Python, Cargo, and npm Artifactory registries.

npm trusted publishing has its own registry-side constraints:

- Each npm package can only have one trusted publisher configured at a time.
- Configure trusted publishers for `nemo-relay-node`, all seven Node platform
  packages, and `nemo-relay-openclaw` before pushing a release tag.
- npm trusted publishing currently supports GitHub-hosted runners, not
  self-hosted runners.

Stable docs versioning is managed through Fern configuration, not the release
tag workflow. Update the Fern version entries when introducing a stable
documentation version; prerelease tags do not publish a separate documentation
artifact from CI.

## Publish The GitHub Release Entry

After the tag pipeline succeeds, publish or finalize the GitHub Release entry
for that tag.

- Keep complete release notes in GitHub Releases.
- Publish the draft release before announcing `nemo-relay install` commands for
  the new version.
- Do not copy those notes into `CHANGELOG.md` or duplicate the full release
  history in the docs site.
- If you use GitHub-generated notes, review them before publishing. The
  category mapping lives in [`.github/release.yml`](.github/release.yml).

## Post-Release Checks

After the release is live, verify:

1. The `nemo-relay-types`, `nemo-relay-plugin`, `nemo-relay-worker-proto`,
   `nemo-relay-worker`, `nemo-relay`, `nemo-relay-adaptive`,
   `nemo-relay-pii-redaction`, `nemo-relay-switchyard`, `nemo-relay-ffi`, and
   `nemo-relay-cli` crates
   are visible on crates.io.
2. The `nemo-relay` and `nemo-relay-cli-bin` wheels are visible on PyPI, and
   `pip install "nemo-relay[cli]"` exposes `nemo-relay`.
3. The `nemo-relay-node`, its seven platform packages, and
   `nemo-relay-openclaw` are visible on npm.
4. The Unix and Windows installers resolve the new stable tag and verify
   matching CLI release asset checksums on their supported platforms.
5. The Fern documentation site shows the expected version and release notes.
6. The GitHub Release page is complete and accurate.

## If Something Fails

Use the failure point to decide how to recover:

- If the tag pipeline fails before any registry publish step succeeds, fix the
  issue and rerun or replace the tag as appropriate.
- If any package has already been published to a public registry, do not reuse
  the same version number. Prepare a follow-up patch or prerelease instead.
- If only the GitHub Release text is wrong, edit the GitHub Release entry
  directly. Do not create a duplicate notes surface in the repository.
