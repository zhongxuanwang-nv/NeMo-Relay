# Contribute Docs Or Examples

## Companion Guidance

Use `karpathy-guidelines` alongside this skill for implementation or review
work. Keep changes scoped, surface assumptions, and define focused validation
before editing.

Use this skill for docs-only or example-heavy changes.

## Rules

- Prefer the documented public API, not internal shortcuts
- Keep package names, repo references, and build commands current
- When documenting contribution workflow, require an issue before external contribution PRs and note that NVIDIA contributors may use a GitHub or Linear issue.
- Update entry-point docs when examples or reading paths change
- Keep release-process and release-notes guidance in repo-maintainer docs such as
  `RELEASING.md`, not as user-facing docs pages or `CHANGELOG.md`
- Keep stable user-facing wrappers at `scripts/` root in docs and examples;
  only point at namespaced helper paths when documenting internal maintenance
  work
- When detailed dynamic plugin guides exist, keep Rust native plugin examples,
  Python worker plugin examples, and `grpc-v1` protocol details on separate
  pages.
- Dynamic plugin manifests must exclude Relay versions before 0.8. Recommend
  `compat.relay = ">=0.8.0,<1.0"`; open-ended or narrower 0.8-or-newer ranges
  are valid when intentional.
- In MDX files, top-of-file comments must use JSX comment delimiters:
  `{/*` to open and `*/}` to close. Do not use HTML comments for MDX SPDX
  headers.
- Render images, diagrams, tables, and other visual content at representative
  page widths. Size visual content for legibility and complete access without
  clipping. Choose responsive scaling, reflow, or overflow based on the content,
  and scope visual-specific styling as narrowly as practical.

## Checklist

- [ ] `README.md` or `docs/index.md` updated when entry points changed
- [ ] Relevant getting-started or reference docs updated
- [ ] Example commands still match current package names and paths
- [ ] Relevant package or crate `README.md` files updated when examples or binding guidance changed
- [ ] Dynamic plugin entry pages link to native, worker, Rust example, Python
      example, and protocol pages when those pages exist
- [ ] New or regenerated MDX files use `{/* ... */}` for top-of-file SPDX comments
- [ ] Images, diagrams, tables, and custom visual content remain legible and
      fully accessible at representative desktop and narrow page widths
- [ ] Release-policy docs still point to GitHub Releases as the only release-history source of truth
- [ ] Run `just docs` when the docs site changed; `./scripts/build-docs.sh html` remains the compatibility wrapper
