# NeMo Relay Plugin

This package contains a native MCP lifecycle client and Claude Code hook entries
that forward canonical Claude Code hook JSON to `nemo-relay` at
`/hooks/claude-code`.

Claude Code is the supported Claude integration target. Claude application,
Claude web, and Claude desktop sessions are unsupported unless they expose the
same local hook and gateway controls as Claude Code.

## Files

The package contains these files:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` describes the Claude Code hook package.
- `.mcp.json` starts the native `nemo-relay mcp` lifecycle client.
- `hooks/hooks.json` contains hook entries that run
  `nemo-relay hook-forward claude --forward-only`.

## Captured Events

The bundle forwards `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
`UserPromptExpansion`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`,
`PermissionRequest`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Notification`, `Stop`,
`PreCompact`, and `PostCompact` as scope, tool, mark, or private LLM
correlation events.

The bundle requires Claude Code 2.1.121 or newer. That version provides the
`alwaysLoad` MCP startup barrier used to make Relay ready before session hooks
and accepts the complete generated hook schema. Installation fails before
changing host state when the version is too old, and `nemo-relay doctor`
reports the required upgrade.

Claude Code observability is turn-oriented. A multi-turn session can produce one
root `claude-code-turn` span or ATIF trajectory per user turn. That is expected
when each turn has a real prompt input and assistant output. Known startup
probes, uncorrelatable late stop hooks, and other lifecycle-only noise are
excluded from exported user traces so they do not appear as synthetic `null`,
`user: test`, or `idle_timeout` turns.
The gateway records suppressed startup probes as debug-level
`observability_bypassed` events when debug or trace logging is enabled.

## Transparent Setup

Build or install the gateway binary so `nemo-relay` is on `PATH`.

Run Claude Code through the wrapper:

```bash
nemo-relay run -- claude
```

The wrapper starts a per-invocation gateway on a dynamic localhost port,
creates a temporary Claude plugin directory, and passes it with `--plugin-dir`.
It also creates a private settings overlay that preserves the caller's first
explicit `--settings` object and overrides only `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for the
launched process. Relay removes both temporary artifacts when Claude exits and
does not rewrite the source settings or user-level plugin state. An enabled
Relay plugin MCP authenticates, borrows, and monitors the wrapper-owned dynamic
gateway, and its persistent hooks become no-ops for this process; only the
temporary hook source delivers lifecycle data after authenticating that
gateway.

Inspect the launch without starting Claude Code:

```bash
nemo-relay run \
  --dry-run \
  --print \
  -- claude
```

## Shared Config

Use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nemo-relay/config.toml` or
`~/.config/nemo-relay/config.toml` for user defaults:

```toml
[agents.claude]
command = "claude"
```

Configure observability with `nemo-relay plugins edit` or the XDG user
`plugins.toml`:

```toml
version = 1

[[components]]
kind = "observability"
enabled = true

[components.config.atif]
enabled = true
output_directory = ".nemo-relay/atif"
```

Then run:

```bash
nemo-relay run --agent claude
```

## Standalone Gateway

Use the long-running gateway only when you do not want to launch Claude Code
through the wrapper. Start the gateway in one terminal:

```bash
nemo-relay --bind 127.0.0.1:4040
```

Launch Claude Code from another terminal with the gateway environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4040
claude
```

In manual gateway-only mode without the plugin installed, hook events such as
tool calls and session markers are only captured when running through the
wrapper, which injects ephemeral hooks per run.

## Verify

Run a Claude Code session that starts, uses one tool, and ends. Confirm
that ATIF was written:

```bash
ls .nemo-relay/atif
```

For a direct endpoint smoke test against a manually started gateway:

```bash
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:4040/healthz
printf '{"session_id":"smoke-claude","hook_event_name":"SessionStart"}' \
  | NEMO_RELAY_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4040 nemo-relay hook-forward claude --fail-closed
```

If hooks arrive but LLM spans are missing, confirm the Claude Code process was
started by `nemo-relay run` or has `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set to the
gateway URL.

If LLM spans are present but attached to the top-level agent instead of a
subagent, include `x-nemo-relay-subagent-id` on gateway requests or share
`conversation_id`, `generation_id`, or `request_id` values between hook payloads
and provider requests.

Relay records correlation diagnostics on exported spans instead of guessing
ownership. Inspect `llm_correlation_status`, `llm_correlation_source`, and
`llm_correlation_subagent_id` for LLM routing, and
`tool_correlation_status`, `tool_correlation_source`, and
`tool_correlation_subagent_id` for tool routing. Fallback statuses such as
`agent_fallback` and `ambiguous_fallback` mean Relay kept the span under the
active turn because the hook and gateway payloads did not prove a subagent
owner.

Late `SubagentStop` hooks with no matching `SubagentStart` are diagnostic-only.
When there is no active turn, Relay logs the missing subagent and suppresses the
hook from ATOF, OpenInference, and ATIF so it cannot create a null turn. When an
unknown subagent end arrives during an active turn, Relay may emit a
`subagent_end_without_start` mark under that turn.

Hook events are only available when Claude Code loads this plugin. A standalone
gateway observes Anthropic LLM traffic, but it cannot recover missing prompt,
tool, compaction, notification, or subagent hooks.

## Standalone Plugin Installation

Preferred release install:

```bash
nemo-relay install claude-code
```

`nemo-relay install claude-code` writes a local Claude Code marketplace,
installs `nemo-relay-plugin` at user scope, and enables Claude Code provider
routing through NeMo Relay. Its plugin MCP process immediately starts or reuses
the shared native gateway on `127.0.0.1:47632` and heartbeats it while MCP stdio
remains open. Codex and Claude Code MCP clients can share
that gateway.

The generated MCP entry sets `alwaysLoad: true`, so Claude Code waits
for the MCP connection during startup, while `nemo-relay mcp` starts or reuses
the gateway immediately when its process launches. The command hook waits for
and authenticates that MCP-owned gateway but never starts or recovers it. The
MCP server advertises no tools and does not add tool definitions to Claude's
context.

No separate provider-routing command is required when installing through
`nemo-relay install`.

The install command requires `nemo-relay` to be available on `PATH`. It does not
require launching Claude Code through the `nemo-relay` wrapper.

Package or unpack the plugin so the plugin root contains:

```text
nemo-relay-plugin/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json
  .mcp.json
  hooks/hooks.json
```

Persistent mode uses system and user Relay configuration only and starts the
gateway in the user configuration directory. Use
`nemo-relay run --agent claude` when project-specific Relay configuration is
required.

Repo marketplace discovery is also supported:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay \
  --sparse .claude-plugin integrations/coding-agents/claude-code
claude plugin install nemo-relay-plugin@nemo-relay --scope user
```

That path reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from the repository and
installs this Claude Code plugin from `integrations/coding-agents/claude-code`.
The source plugin starts `nemo-relay mcp`; its hooks use the explicit
`--forward-only` mode to post to that existing gateway without an
installer-owned generation fence. They cannot launch or recover Relay. Use
`nemo-relay install claude-code` for complete provider routing and
generation-fenced upgrades. Remove the source-installed plugin first; keeping
both plugins active can forward the same lifecycle payload twice.

Create a local Claude Code marketplace and copy the plugin under that
marketplace root:

```bash
MARKETPLACE_ROOT="$HOME/.local/share/nemo-relay/claude-code-marketplace"
PLUGIN_ROOT="$MARKETPLACE_ROOT/plugins/nemo-relay-plugin"
mkdir -p "$MARKETPLACE_ROOT/.claude-plugin" "$MARKETPLACE_ROOT/plugins"
cp -R /path/to/nemo-relay-plugin "$PLUGIN_ROOT"
```

Create `$MARKETPLACE_ROOT/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "nemo-relay-local",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Local NeMo Relay plugins for Claude Code."
  },
  "owner": {
    "name": "NVIDIA Corporation and Affiliates",
    "email": "noreply@nvidia.com"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "nemo-relay-plugin",
      "description": "Run the shared native Relay gateway and capture Claude Code lifecycle events.",
      "source": "./plugins/nemo-relay-plugin",
      "category": "development"
    }
  ]
}
```

Validate the marketplace, add it to Claude Code, and install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin validate "$MARKETPLACE_ROOT"
claude plugin marketplace add "$MARKETPLACE_ROOT"
claude plugin install nemo-relay-plugin@nemo-relay-local --scope user
```

For a one-session development smoke test without persistent plugin
installation, launch Claude Code with the plugin directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir "$PLUGIN_ROOT"
```

Hook commands in the source `hooks/hooks.json` template use
`nemo-relay hook-forward claude --forward-only`, so source marketplace installs
rely on the same `nemo-relay` executable available on `PATH` and on their
`alwaysLoad` MCP entry for gateway startup.

If you set up the marketplace manually for development, use the top-level
installer commands for provider routing and rollback:

```bash
nemo-relay install claude-code
nemo-relay uninstall claude-code
```

Run read-only plugin checks:

```bash
nemo-relay doctor --plugin claude-code
```

Start a normal Claude Code session:

```bash
claude
```

The installed MCP client starts the Relay sidecar before Claude Code proceeds
with session startup. If the sidecar becomes unhealthy, overlapping MCP clients
coordinate one recovery attempt. Hook forwarding waits for that recovery but
does not initiate it. Provider traffic is routed through
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:47632`.

To upgrade manually, replace the plugin directory contents with the new package,
keep the same `MARKETPLACE_ROOT`, update the marketplace, and rerun the
top-level installer:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update nemo-relay-local
claude plugin update nemo-relay-plugin
nemo-relay install claude-code --force
```

To uninstall, restore Claude Code provider settings, uninstall the plugin, remove
the marketplace registration, and remove the generated marketplace directory:

```bash
nemo-relay uninstall claude-code
```
