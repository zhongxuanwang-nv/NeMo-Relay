## Description: <br>
Use this skill when choosing or running NeMo Relay installation for the CLI, Python, Node.js, Rust, OpenClaw, or maintained framework integrations, or when explaining Hermes Agent's built-in Relay integration. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers installing the NeMo Relay CLI, language packages (Python, Node.js, Rust), or maintained framework integrations (LangChain, LangGraph, Deep Agents, OpenClaw), plus Hermes Agent users who need the native built-in Relay path. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- claude-code <br>
- codex <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 10 tasks (9 positive skill-activation, 1 negative) in NVSkills-Eval external profile, astra-sandbox environment, 1 attempt per task, 50% pass threshold. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 8 | 100% (+0%) | 95% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 8 | 82% (+65%) | 84% (+22%) |
| Discoverability | 8 | 78% (+61%) | 84% (+48%) |
| Effectiveness | 8 | 80% (+59%) | 77% (+23%) |
| Efficiency | 8 | 76% (+41%) | 82% (+44%) |
