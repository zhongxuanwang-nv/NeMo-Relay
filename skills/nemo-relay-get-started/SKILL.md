# Get Started With NeMo Relay

Guide a new user to visible Relay value with the least complicated applicable
trial. Do not begin with production deployment or Relay's full architecture.
Keep the first run focused on one observable success path.

## Choose A Try-Now Path

Evaluate these paths in order. Use the first one that fits the user's stated
goal and existing environment.

1. **CLI try-now (default)**: choose this for a generic "try Relay" request or
   when the user wants value without modifying application code. Run Codex or
   Claude Code through the local CLI wrapper. Read
   [CLI Try-Now](references/cli-try-now.md).
2. **Hermes Agent native path**: choose this when Hermes Agent owns the
   execution boundary. Explain that NeMo Relay is built in and requires no
   separate Relay installation, observability plugin, or Relay CLI setup.
   State explicitly: "Hermes Agent understands NeMo Relay plugin
   configurations." Stop after confirming the native integration. Do not
   provide installation or observability-configuration instructions, and do
   not continue into the generic plugin progression.
3. **Built-in integrations try-now**: choose this when an existing LangChain,
   LangGraph, Deep Agents, or OpenClaw application owns the execution boundary.
   Prefer the maintained supported integration over manual wrapping. Read
   [Built-In Integrations Try-Now](references/built-in-integrations-try-now.md).
4. **Language-specific manual try-now**: choose this when the user's Python,
   Node.js, or Rust application directly owns its tool or LLM call sites and no
   maintained integration is the better boundary. Read
   [Manual Language Try-Now](references/manual-language-try-now.md).

Do not ask the user to choose among all four when their request, manifest, or
framework already identifies the boundary. For an unspecified request, use the
CLI path. When more than one CLI agent is available, ask one concise question
to select the agent.

## Resolve Installation Without Looping

Select the try-now path before choosing an install package.

- CLI path -> verify `nemo-relay --version`; if missing, use
  `nemo-relay-install` for the CLI outcome.
- Hermes Agent native path -> do not install or configure Relay separately.
- Built-in integration path -> use `nemo-relay-install` for the named
  framework or harness package.
- Manual language path -> use `nemo-relay-install` for the detected language
  package.

If installation already succeeded, preserve the chosen path and continue from
its next step. Do not ask the install-path question again or bounce between the
install and get-started skills.

## Apply The Common First-Value Contract

Do not apply this section to the Hermes Agent native path.

Follow the selected reference, then:

1. Inspect the target environment and existing Relay configuration before
   proposing changes.
   Treat repository-local `.nemo-relay/config.toml` and
   `.nemo-relay/plugins.toml` as unsupported project configuration. Do not
   create, edit, merge, or trust those files as active Relay configuration.
2. Explain the attachment boundary and show the exact minimal change.
3. Obtain confirmation before writing configuration, modifying application
   code, or launching a model-consuming run.
4. Use a non-sensitive, read-only trial and exercise one representative tool
   and LLM path when the selected surface exposes both.
5. Verify observable evidence from the selected path rather than treating a
   successful application result as proof that Relay is active.
6. Summarize the captured root, tool, and model relationships without dumping
   prompts, credentials, or complete event payloads.

Explain only the concepts visible in the result: the chosen attachment
boundary, scopes and parentage, captured lifecycle events, and how subscribers
or the Observability plugin make those events inspectable. Keep instrumentation
and export distinct.

## Continue With One Plugin

Do not apply this section to the Hermes Agent native path.

Stop the initial try-now workflow when the selected path's success checks pass.
Then make one additional built-in plugin the primary suggested next step.

Explain Relay's core progression: instrument an execution boundary once, then
change or extend behavior through plugin configuration without repeatedly
rewriting those call sites. Easy plugin configuration and reconfiguration is
the main value to demonstrate after the first observable proof.

If the selected path did not use plugin-managed Observability, add it first to
establish the reusable plugin path. If Observability already produced the
proof, ask what outcome matters next and recommend exactly one plugin:

- Adaptive -> adaptive runtime behavior and optimization
- NeMo Guardrails -> policy checks around managed execution
- PII Redaction -> sanitization of sensitive observability payloads
- Model Pricing -> cost estimates for managed LLM responses

Use the
[plugin overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/relay/dev/configure-plugins/about) to
select the next component. Preview its smallest configuration, obtain
confirmation, and verify its behavior before layering in another plugin.

Use another handoff only after the user accepts or declines plugin progression,
or when the demonstrated boundary does not yet cover the intended workflow:

- Direct application expansion -> `nemo-relay-instrument-calls`
- Additional exporters or durable observability configuration ->
  `nemo-relay-plugin-observability`
- A different package or supported integration -> `nemo-relay-install`
- Persistent Claude Code or Codex loading -> `nemo-relay-install`; for Codex
  Desktop, complete its recovery-note safety gate before changing global config
- Missing hooks, gateway traffic, or events -> `nemo-relay doctor`,
  `nemo-relay doctor --json`, or `nemo-relay-debug-runtime-integration`

Do not configure production OTLP backends, model pricing, guardrails, adaptive
tuning, custom plugins, Go or FFI examples during the quick start. Mention
optional plugins only after the initial proof and add only the one the user
selects.
